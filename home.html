                  I was in dire straits with the IRS. My business owed over $35k
                  in taxes and more in penalties. One could say my business
                  existence was ‚Äútoxic.‚Äù I was looking for help one night, I saw
                  this ad to ‚ÄúDetaxify‚Äù my situation. I thought the phrase was
                  super catchy and did some preliminary background research on
                  John and his company. I reached out that night, and he
                  personally called me back‚Ä¶ THAT NIGHT. We had a plan of action
                  in a matter of days! Picking up the phone to call John was the
                  best business decision I‚Äôve made in years. He not only helped
                  me resolve my issues (saving me and my company THOUSANDS),
                  he‚Äôs got me (and my company) compliant and on the path to
                  making my company healthy and stable. No matter the issue,
                  Detaxify has the solution!

                  I owed the IRS roughly $50k due to unfiled payroll tax

                  and 941s which we had to file for our business and I had not
                  properly managed the deposits with the IRS. The situation
                  spiraled out of control as I had penalties and interest
                  assessed on top of my liability; the IRS was threatening to
                  close down the business. Detaxify really saved the day by

              For most cases involving a tax liability, we begin representation
              by having you sign and remit to us several IRS forms. The main
              form is a Form 2848 which allows us to speak directly to the IRS
              on your behalf so that we can request a hold against collection
              action and negotiate directly with your assigned revenue officer.
              We then send you a financial questionnaire which must be filled in
              and sent back to us. At that point, there will be some back and
              forth between you and our firm as we work to prepare your
              resolution matter and/or negotiate directly with an assigned
              revenue officer. Depending on the resolution matter, cases will
              vary moving forward, but these are the basic steps to getting

              If you have a tax debt, and the IRS or state collection agencies
              are in the process of collecting, both individuals and businesses
              can qualify for certain tax relief measures. These could be a
              reprieve against collections wherein all notices and threats of
              asset seizure are suspended, an agreement to waive accrued
              penalties on the initial tax liability, or in certain cases a
              suspension of collection altogether and a mediation of the tax
              liability. As qualifications for these measures vary from case to
              case, understanding your options and getting current with an
              accurate road-map are important considerations our associates will
              sit with you and go over in depth.

              Many taxpayers will accumulate tax debt at an alarming rate when
              their returns are not filed because the IRS submits the return for
              them on their behalf, commonly referred to as an SFR (Substitute
              for Return). This is the worst form of taxation as it allows for
              zero deductions and maximizes the IRS‚Äôs revenue. We assist many
              clients who haven‚Äôt filed their tax returns in years, and in many
              cases, we can reduce the liability that has accrued, bring the
              taxpayer legally current, and maintain their returns with our
              year-over-year tax planning and preparation service.

              For the most part, we are generally able to stop most forms of
              collections against our clients quickly. When you decide to take
              advantage of our services, we will assume tax power of attorney
              which allows us to do several very important things for you.
              First, it gives us authority to speak to the IRS on your behalf,
              letting us contact the IRS and request either a 30, 60, or 90 day
              hold on collections, and when appropriate, we can even place an
              account into what‚Äôs called CNC ‚Äì Currently Non Collectible,
              wherein the IRS will cease collection action indefinitely. The
              second thing the 2848 allows us to do is get your mail and
              notices, which keeps us current with your case and directs
              correspondence through our office instead of your mailbox. From
              here, we will work with you to tailor a program or relief option
              best suited to your needs.

              Prices will vary considerably depending on the scope of work
              needed to be done and complexity to your general liability issue.
              In many cases, the work on your case spans over a couple of months
              ‚Äì however, we charge flat fees even if your case takes longer than
              usual. We find that it benefits the consumer to pay a fair fee for
              a fair service. There are simply no cutting corners. In many cases
              we offer interest free financing of our fee, allowing you to make
              payments over time. A general range for our services is as
              follows: simple tax returns can cost a few hundred dollars each,
              simple tax resolution cases can be between fifteen hundred and
              twenty five hundred each, and more complex cases can cost in the
              thousands. As fees vary based on work, such as returns needing to
              be filed and garnishments needing to be lifted, please contact one
              of our tax associates for a free evaluation of your options and to
              better price your tax issues.
