                If you have filed years of back taxes resulting in unpaid taxes,
                it is essential to evaluate your options and to consider
                settlement options which may be available to you. It is
                essential to make arrangements with the IRS or state tax
                authority in order to avoid your account being placed into
                collections.

                The IRS and state tax authorities are unforgiving when it comes
                to wage garnishments. With the IRS, if you’re single without
                dependents, they can garnish your entire paycheck and leave you
                with only $469.23 on a bi-weekly basis. It’s essential to get on
                a tax resolution plan to stop a wage garnishment and to prevent
                further collection action from the IRS or state tax authority.

                Ignoring the IRS can result in having Federal Tax Liens filed
                against you. This becomes public record available for access in
                the county which it was filed. This can result in you being
                prevented from selling a home, selling other assets, obtaining a
                loan, and it may negatively impact your credit. Obtain tax
                relief sooner than later in order to prevent an IRS tax lien
                from being filed against you.

                  I was in dire straits with the IRS. My business owed over $35k
                  in taxes and more in penalties. One could say my business
                  existence was “toxic.” I was looking for help one night, I saw
                  this ad to “Detaxify” my situation. I thought the phrase was
                  super catchy and did some preliminary background research on
                  John and his company. I reached out that night, and he
                  personally called me back… THAT NIGHT. We had a plan of action
                  in a matter of days! Picking up the phone to call John was the
                  best business decision I’ve made in years. He not only helped
                  me resolve my issues (saving me and my company THOUSANDS),
                  he’s got me (and my company) compliant and on the path to
                  making my company healthy and stable. No matter the issue,
                  Detaxify has the solution!

                  I owed the IRS roughly $50k due to unfiled payroll tax

                  and 941s which we had to file for our business and I had not
                  properly managed the deposits with the IRS. The situation
                  spiraled out of control as I had penalties and interest
                  assessed on top of my liability; the IRS was threatening to
